I'm a spanish guy, currently studying Software Engineering at University of Cordoba. My passions in development are front-end and team side projects.

I've been working as an Junior Developer at [@AudienseCo](https://github.com/AudienseCo) since February 2021.

- üöÄ I‚Äôm currently working in a side project in React Native, which has been made by a group of 5 as a university project. It's called [Ilyb (I Love Your Book)](https://github.com/ILoveYourBook/Ilyb), and it consists of a Tinder clone for trading books.
- üî• I've grown up with awesome people at [Free Software Club of University of Cordoba](https://github.com/aulasoftwarelibre), where we've worked in several side projects together.
- üèê My hobbies are sports (voleyball is life), cinema, languages and music.
- üåü Contact me at [francisjmp99@gmail.com](mailto:francisjmp99@gmail.com).
